# Message lifecycle and state transitions

A message's lifecycle is **derived state**, not a stored column. The
`messages` table stores three timestamps/counters and the lifecycle is
computed from them on every read:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `invisible_until` | Message is hidden from receives while this is in the future; `NULL` or past means available |
| `tries` | Delivery attempts so far (bumped on every receive) |
| `delivered_at` | When the message was last received (informational; availability is governed only by `invisible_until`) |
| `receipt_handle` | Handle minted on the most recent receive: `<id>:<128-bit random hex>`. Replaced by every redelivery |

The displayed status ([`src/message.rs`](../../src/message.rs)) is computed as:

```sql
CASE
  WHEN delivered_at IS NOT NULL AND invisible_until > now THEN 'delivered'   -- in flight
  WHEN tries >= max_retries                               THEN 'failed'      -- exhausted
  ELSE                                                         'pending'     -- available
END
```

So `delivered` means **currently in flight** (received, visibility window
still open), not "successfully consumed". The only durable record of
successful consumption is the message being *gone* — `DeleteMessage` removes
the row. This is standard queue semantics, but worth internalizing because
the admin UI surfaces these statuses.

                  (never claimable again;
                   admin "requeue" resets it)
```

The claim is a single atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (SELECT ... LIMIT n)`
statement ([`src/service.rs`](../../src/service.rs), `sqs_recv_batch`), so
two concurrent consumers can never receive the same in-flight message.

### Effective visibility timeout

On receive, the window is stamped from the first available of:

1. the request's `VisibilityTimeout` override,
2. the queue's `VisibilityTimeout` attribute,
3. the server default (`VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT`, 30 s).

`ChangeMessageVisibility` re-stamps the deadline **from now** (not from the
original receive), capped at AWS's 43,200 s (12 h). Setting it to `0`
releases the message immediately.

## Receipt handles, not message IDs

Acknowledgement is keyed on the **receipt handle**, never the message ID:

- `DeleteMessage`, `DeleteMessageBatch` and `ChangeMessageVisibility` all
  match `WHERE queue = ? AND receipt_handle = ?`. The message ID in the
  request plays no role (it isn't even sent for these operations).
- Every receive **replaces** the handle, so a handle identifies *one
  specific delivery* of a message, not the message itself.
- Handles are scoped to the queue and contain 128 bits of randomness —
  unguessable, and a handle from one queue can never act on another.

The resulting acknowledgement rules:

| Situation | `DeleteMessage` | `ChangeMessageVisibility` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In flight, current handle | ✅ deletes | ✅ re-stamps window |
| Window lapsed, **not yet redelivered** (handle still the latest) | ✅ deletes — matches AWS: the handle outlives the timeout until the next receive | ❌ 404 — matches AWS `MessageNotInflight` |
| Window lapsed, **redelivered to another consumer** (handle replaced) | ❌ 404 | ❌ 404 |
| Handle never issued / message gone | ❌ 404 | ❌ 404 |

So the answer to "a consumer missed its visibility timeout — can it still
delete the message?" is: **yes, until someone else receives it; afterwards
its handle is dead and the message belongs to the new delivery.**

### Divergence: stale-handle deletes are errors, not silent no-ops

AWS **standard** queues return `200 OK` for a `DeleteMessage` with a stale
receipt handle — the call "succeeds" but deletes nothing (only FIFO queues
report an error). NerveMQ always reports a stale or unknown handle as an
error (404, surfaced as `ReceiptHandleIsInvalid` per entry in
`DeleteMessageBatch`). This is stricter than AWS and arguably more useful —
a consumer learns it lost the race — but SDK code written for AWS standard
queues may not expect `delete_message` to raise.

## Retry exhaustion (`failed`)

Every receive increments `tries`; the claim query only considers messages
with `tries < max_retries` (queue configuration, default 10). A message
received `max_retries` times without being deleted is never claimable again
and reports `failed`.

AWS has no equivalent outside of a redrive policy — a standard queue
redelivers forever, and with a redrive policy the message is *moved to the
DLQ* after `maxReceiveCount` receives. NerveMQ's failed messages instead
**stay in the source queue** until an admin deletes, purges, or requeues
them:

- **Dead-letter routing is not implemented.** `queue_configurations.
  dead_letter_queue` and the `RedrivePolicy` attribute are stored and
  round-trip through the API/UI, but no code path ever moves a message.
- **`MessageRetentionPeriod` is not enforced.** The attribute is stored and
  round-trips, but nothing ever expires messages by age.

## Admin (management-plane) transitions

The admin API can force lifecycle state by **message ID** — it is the
management plane and deliberately does not hold receipt handles
([`src/api/queue.rs`](../../src/api/queue.rs)):

- **Requeue (`status = pending`)**: `invisible_until = NULL, tries = 0` —
  makes the message immediately deliverable, whether it was in flight or
  exhausted.
- **Mark failed (`status = failed`)**: saturates `tries` to `max_retries` —
  no further deliveries.
- **`status = delivered` is rejected** (400): `delivered` only ever results
  from a real receive minting a receipt handle.
- **Delete by ID**: removes the message regardless of in-flight state.

### Sharp edge: requeue does not invalidate the outstanding receipt handle

Forcing a message back to `pending` clears its visibility window and retry
counter but leaves `receipt_handle` untouched. The consumer holding the
pre-requeue handle can therefore still `DeleteMessage` (or
`ChangeMessageVisibility` is blocked only by the not-in-flight guard) until
the next receive replaces the handle. In practice this means an admin
"requeue" does not fence off the old consumer the way a redelivery does.
Pinned by `admin_requeue_leaves_prior_receipt_handle_deletable` in
[`src/service.rs`](../../src/service.rs); a fix would add
`receipt_handle = NULL` to the requeue (and arguably the mark-failed)
`UPDATE`.

## Delayed messages

`DelaySeconds` (request field, capped at 900 s, or the queue's
`DelaySeconds` attribute) stamps `invisible_until` at **send** time without
counting a delivery attempt. The delay reuses the visibility mechanism, so a
delayed message is simply "in the future" until the delay lapses.

### Inconsistency: delayed messages fall through the statistics buckets

The two derived-status code paths disagree about a delayed (or any
never-delivered but currently invisible) message:

- `list_messages` reports it as `pending` (its `CASE` has no
  window-elapsed condition on the `pending` arm), so the UI lists it as
  pending;
- `queue_statistics` counts `pending` as *window elapsed and tries < max*,
  `delivered` as *delivered_at set and window open*, `failed` as *window
  elapsed and tries >= max* — a delayed message satisfies none of these, so
  it is included in `message_count` but in **no** status bucket, and the
  three buckets do not sum to the total.

Pinned by `delayed_message_is_listed_pending_but_counted_in_no_stats_bucket`
in [`src/service.rs`](../../src/service.rs).

## Delivery order

There is exactly one ordering rule: the claim query selects available
messages `ORDER BY m.id ASC` ([`src/service.rs`](../../src/service.rs),
`sqs_recv_batch`). `id` is the auto-incrementing rowid assigned at send
time, and sends are serialized by SQLite's single-writer lock, so the base
order is **strict FIFO by send order** — oldest available message first.

Because a message never changes its `id`, it never moves to the back of the
queue. Coming back from *any* form of requeue means re-entering at the
original position:

| How a message becomes available again | Position on next delivery |
| --- | --- |
| Visibility window lapsed (consumer never acked) | Original — ahead of everything sent after it |
| `ChangeMessageVisibility(handle, 0)` | Original, immediately |
| Admin requeue (`status = pending`, `tries = 0`) | Original |
| `DelaySeconds` elapsed | The position its send-time `id` gave it |

Two consequences:

1. **Head-of-line behavior**: a poison message that keeps timing out is
   redelivered *first* every time it resurfaces, ahead of all newer
   messages, until its retries exhaust and it parks as `failed` (dropping
   out of the claim query). An admin requeue resets `tries`, granting it a
   fresh set of attempts at the front again.
2. **Batch receives** claim the *n* lowest-id available messages
   atomically, so ordering holds across batches and concurrent consumers
   receive disjoint runs of the head of the queue.

### Contrast with AWS SQS standard queues

NerveMQ's ordering is *stronger* than what SQS standard queues promise, and
code written against it should not assume AWS will behave the same way:

| Behaviour | NerveMQ | AWS SQS standard queue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base ordering | Strict FIFO by send order | **Best-effort only** — messages are stored across distributed servers and can arrive out of order; no ordering guarantee at all |
| Delivery guarantee | Exactly-once *per visibility window*: the claim is one atomic `UPDATE`, so two consumers can never hold the same message concurrently | **At-least-once**: a message can occasionally be delivered more than once, even concurrently, because a copy on an unreachable server can resurface |
| Position after a visibility lapse | Returns to its original (front-most) position — head-of-line behavior | Undefined — the message simply becomes available again somewhere in the (unordered) pool; no head-of-line effect |
| Redelivery limit | Stops after `max_retries` receives, parks as `failed` in the source queue | Redelivers forever; with a redrive policy, moves to the DLQ after `maxReceiveCount` receives |
| Duplicates | Never duplicated by the server | Consumers must be idempotent; duplicates are expected behavior |

The nearest AWS analogue to NerveMQ's ordering is a **FIFO queue**, but the
match is loose there too: AWS FIFO queues order *per message group*
(`MessageGroupId`, which NerveMQ accepts on the wire but ignores), enforce
exactly-once via deduplication IDs (also ignored), and block a message
group while one of its messages is in flight. NerveMQ orders the whole
queue globally and lets delivery continue past in-flight messages.

Practical upshot: a consumer written for NerveMQ that silently relies on
FIFO order or on never seeing duplicates will misbehave when pointed at
real SQS standard queues. The portable assumptions are the ones both make:
ack with the latest receipt handle, and treat order and delivery count as
queue-implementation details.

## Known validation gaps on ReceiveMessage

`ChangeMessageVisibility` validates its timeout (0–43,200), but
`ReceiveMessage` does not validate the equivalent inputs that AWS rejects:

- `VisibilityTimeout` override above 43,200 s is accepted as-is (AWS:
  `InvalidParameterValue`). Pinned by
  `receive_accepts_visibility_override_beyond_aws_maximum`.
- `MaxNumberOfMessages` above 10 is honored rather than rejected (AWS:
  error; at most 10 messages per receive).
- `WaitTimeSeconds` above 20 is silently clamped to 20 rather than rejected.

## Concurrency note

`delete_message` and `change_message_visibility` are deliberately single
atomic statements — a read-then-write transaction would fail concurrent
acknowledgers with `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` instead of letting them lose the
race cleanly (see the comments at their definitions).
`delete_message_batch` does *not* follow this pattern: it opens a
transaction with several `SELECT`s (namespace/access/queue checks) before
its `DELETE`s, so under heavy concurrent ack load a batch delete can hit
`SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` and fail with a 500 where the single delete would
have returned a clean per-entry error.
